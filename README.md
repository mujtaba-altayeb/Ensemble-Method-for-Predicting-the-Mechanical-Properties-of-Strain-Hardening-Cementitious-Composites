# Ensemble-Method-for-Predicting-the-Mechanical-Properties-of-Strain-Hardening-Cementitious-Composites
A project that aims to build a model for predicting the behavior of Strain hardening cementitious composites also known as Engineered Cementitious Composites

This project contains the SHCC data files and Codes for the FDNN Algorithm from the paper "An Ensemble Method for Predicting the Mechanical Properties of Strain Hardening Cementitious Composites" in CONSTRUCTION AND BUILDING MATERIALS journal.
The files in this project show our current progress on this work. The team is currently working to simplify the algorithm so that researchers are able to use it for any other applications.
