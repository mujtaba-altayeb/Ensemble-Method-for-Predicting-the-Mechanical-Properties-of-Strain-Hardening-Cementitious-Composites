To develop the model, data were collected from a comprehensive literature review of articles.
The dataset consists of several parameters related to the mix design and mechanical properties of SHCC. The mix design
parameters included in the database are the amount of cement, water, fine aggregate, fly ash, silica fume, cenosphere, blast
furnace slag, superplasticiser, coarse aggregate, accelerating admixtures, phase change materials, fibre weight, all represented
in percentage weight. The parameters related to fibre properties in the dataset are fibre type, volume (% volume), diameter
(Micro-meter), length (mm), tensile strength (MPa), and elastic modulus (GPa). The dataset also included rubber, light weight
aggregate, viscosity agent hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, Air entraining admixture, oiling agent, graphene oxide, and
defoamer represented in binary forms, i.e. 1 (was used in mix design) or 0 (was not used). Other experimental conditions are
included, they are water curing time (days), air curing time (days), high frequency & velocity casting (1 or 0), and temperature
(â¸°C). Finally, the mechanical properties recorded in the dataset are the tensile stress at the first crack (MPa), tensile strain at
the first crack (%), peak tensile stress (MPa), peak tensile strain (%), flexural strength at the first crack (MPa), flexural strain
at the first crack (%), peak flexural Strength (MPa), peak flexural strain (%), and Compressive strength (MPa). In total, the
resulting data set contains 38 parameters, divided into 29 features and nine targets.
